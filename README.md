# Josh Lerner's Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Tweeter is built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX.

## Project description

I was given an incomplete code, containing the server.
The server is built with Node and Express and allows users to request and submit tweets via a JSON end-point. 
I had to work with and implement the HTML, CSS and client-side JS to bring this project to life.
The final product is a responsive twitter clone for mobile and desktop views.
